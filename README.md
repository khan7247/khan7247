## 👋 Hi, I’m a Technologist

I build, fix, automate, and occasionally question systems — across **cloud computing, IT infrastructure, automation, web, and security**.  
I work with **Windows & Linux**, set up and manage **Cloud Service Provider (CSP) accounts**, and execute real-world tasks like deployments, access control, and system configuration (yes, including the boring-but-critical stuff).

I also work with **AI & automation**, **web development & SEO**, **digital marketing support**, and **video/photo editing** — because modern tech rarely lives in just one box.  
I believe in **clean systems, clear communication, documented fixes**, and humor as a survival skill.
