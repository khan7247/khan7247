## 👋 Hi, I’m a Technologist

I work across **IT systems, cloud computing, and automation**, helping set up and manage **Windows/Linux environments** and **Cloud Service Providers (CSPs)** based on real-world requirements. My experience includes system configuration, troubleshooting, security-aware operations, and executing cloud tasks such as account setup, access control, and resource deployment.

I also work with **AI & automation**, **web development and SEO**, **digital marketing support**, and **video & photo editing**, bridging technical infrastructure with practical execution. I value clean systems, clear communication, and reliable outcomes.
